# Titanic
IN DEVELOPMENT: a 3d animation simulation of sinking Titanic made with Irrlicht (not complete; the model has to many triangles!)

As in the title: the model of the Titanic contains too many triangles haven't managed to decimate it. The complex hull for collision withou success. Everything resulted in strange gruesome results.
As uploaded from my computer (last version from 2017) but the media files are not here...
Involves realistic water scene node - part of another project but the shaders of the water are adjusted (no need for refraction here)
Everything initially commited on my local folder (on my MSI computer) at "D:\PROJECTS.017\IrrlichtTitanic\titanic.000.a03\titanic"
